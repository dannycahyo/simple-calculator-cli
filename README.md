### Simple Calculator CLI

#### Description

The Simple Calculator CLI is a command-line interface application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Initial & Solution Directory

- The `initial` directory contains the initial implementation of the Simple Calculator CLI.
- The `solution` directory contains the solution implementation of the Simple Calculator CLI.

**Note:** The `solution` directory is final and contains the completed implementation of the Simple Calculator CLI. Please struggle with the challenge on the `initial` before checking the solution.

#### Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Takes user input from the command line interface.
- Provides immediate results for the performed calculations.

#### Usage

To use the Simple Calculator CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the (initial/solution) `index.js` file.
3. Run the following command with the desired operation and numbers:
   ```
   node index.js [operation] [number1] [number2]
   ```
   Replace `[operation]` with one of the following: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, or `divide`.
   Replace `[number1]` and `[number2]` with the numbers you want to perform the operation on.

#### Example

To add two numbers:

```
node index.js add 5 3
```

Output:

```
Result: 8
```
